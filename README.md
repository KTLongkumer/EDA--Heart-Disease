# EDA--Heart-Disease
To begin this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Heart Disease Prediction dataset, we will follow a structured approach as outlined in the guidelines. Here's the step-by-step plan for our analysis:

Step 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing
Import Necessary Libraries: We will import libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Load the Dataset: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Handle Missing Values: Identify and handle any missing or null values in the dataset.
Data Cleaning: Perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for analysis.
Step 2: Basic Analysis
Basic Statistics: Compute basic statistics like mean, median, and mode for each feature.
Visualize Distributions: Use histograms and boxplots to visualize the distributions of various features.
Initial Insights: Generate initial insights from the basic statistics and visualizations.
Step 3: Intermediate Analysis
Correlation Analysis: Explore correlations between features using a correlation matrix.
Pattern Exploration: Investigate patterns and relationships among features, focusing on those most relevant to heart disease.
Visualization: Create visualizations such as scatter plots and bar charts to support findings.
Step 4: Advanced Analysis
Advanced Visualizations: Utilize heatmaps, pair plots, and t-SNE to identify complex relationships.
Multivariate Analysis: Perform multivariate analysis to see how the presence of heart disease varies with multiple variables simultaneously.
Predictive Modeling (Optional): Prepare the data for predictive modeling and implement models like logistic regression or random forests.
Step 5: Conclusion and Interpretation
Summarize Findings: Summarize key findings and insights derived from the analysis.
Feature Significance: Reflect on the significance of different features in predicting the presence of heart disease.
Further Steps: Suggest potential further steps or analyses that could be performed on the dataset.
